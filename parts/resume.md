I chosed to present the Community Discord Simplon Server

This project consist of centralizing each entities of Simplon on a same Discord Server.
Our team discussed with Simplon teams members and as learner we saw some issues with Simplon communication.
The setup of communications supports of Simplon was extremly messy and so we had to provide a solution to make those process less tedious.
That was the main idea of this project.

I mainly focused on Back End developpement with NestJS & DiscordJS as Bot Developpement Framework
I worked firstly on this project as project for real client with my course mates.

We were 4 from 3 first months, working with Agile method using SCRUM.
When intership period arrived my mates gone in their company to work as intern.

I decided to take this project as internship project because it was an interesting project.
I refactored API side and Bot side from the first month of my internship.
And i'd worked on new features to implemente those to Onboarding Bot whose
goal was to simplify the Onboarding process of new learners.

This project was firstly designed to be a set of 1 API, 1 DB, 1 Web Management & Monitoring Dashboard & 7 Bots, but at this moment
It's 1 finalized bot instead of 7.
